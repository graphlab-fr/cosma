        <p>Last updated: January 27, 2023</p>
        

        <h2 id="about-cosma" tabindex="-1">About Cosma</h2>
<p>Cosma is a document graph visualization tool. It renders interlinked plain text files as an interactive network in a web interface. It can be used to explore and share collections of various sizes, from a few dozen up to several thousands of documents.</p>
<p>Cosma was developed initially as part of the <a href="https://hyperotlet.hypotheses.org/">HyperOtlet</a> research programme (grant number ANR-17-CE38-0011).</p>
<h3 id="a-unique-tool" tabindex="-1">A unique tool</h3>
<p>Among tools for thought, Cosma stands out with <strong>three key aspects</strong>:</p>
<p>First, <strong>Cosma is not a note-taking app</strong>. It is designed to work in conjunction with these programs. This is inspired by software such as <a href="https://www.deckset.com">Deckset</a>, which applies this principle to presentations (write in your favorite editor, visualize elsewhere).</p>
<p>Secondly, <strong>Cosma is based on interoperable, open and standardised writing conventions</strong>. This allows you to use other tools that share these standards (such as <a href="https://www.zettlr.com">Zettlr</a>) and to switch tools more freely. Overall, it increases the durability of your data.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Cosma allows you to simultaneously share your data and the tools to explore it</strong>. What does this mean? Most visualization tools are packed with great functionality, but they only export static images, or structured data that requires software to make any use of. Cosma reverses this logic: what you see in the main window is actually a standalone HTML file, meaning you can share it and thus transmit not just your data, but a fully interactive representation of it.</p>
<p>These three aspects make Cosma a unique proposition among tools for thought.</p>
<h3 id="a-high-degree-of-user-control" tabindex="-1">A high degree of user control</h3>
<p><strong>Cosma works with a directory of text-based files, and only reads them</strong>. Installing, using and uninstalling the app does not alter your files, nor does it interfere with your existing practices for storage, editing and version control.</p>
<p><strong>Many interface elements are customizable</strong>, from the graph layout to the color of nodes and pattern of links. Interesting views can be saved as shortcuts. Users proficient with CSS can use a custom stylesheet.</p>
<p><strong>You can add semantic metadata to records and links through simple writing conventions</strong>. This is done through generic mechanisms, meaning you are free to invent and use any categories to describe your data.</p>
<p><strong>Cosma is free software</strong>. The code is public, its development is documented, it is accessible and reusable for free under the GNU GPL license. Our work can thus be evaluated, archived and continued by others.</p>
<h3 id="a-research-experiment" tabindex="-1">A research experiment</h3>
<p>Cosma was imagined by Arthur Perret as part of his PhD research under the direction of Olivier Le Deuff. This means the project's DNA is very much experimental, and that its use is subject to caution.</p>
<p>However, we also want to popularize plain text-based research and its possibilities to a wider audience of knowledge workers. This means we have tried to design Cosma as a relatively polished and accessible tool.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no dedicated funding to this project. But Cosma is already in use in a few research projects and graduate programs. This encourages us to keep developing it, and to work on securing more funding in the coming years.</p>
<p>Cosma is archived on Zenodo and can be referenced in scientific literature:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="installing-and-updating" tabindex="-1">Installing and updating</h2>
<p>Cosma is available in two versions: a graphical user interface (GUI) application and a command line interface (CLI) application. Information about the CLI version is detailed <a href="#cosma-cli">in the dedicated section</a>.</p>
<p>The GUI version of Cosma is available for macOS and Windows. The CLI version is available for macOS, Windows and Linux. Visit <a href="https://cosma.graphlab.fr/telecharger/">the Download page on Cosma’s website to get the latest version of the application</a>. Please note that the application is not signed with a security certificate, so you must have administrator privileges on your session to run it.</p>
<dl>
<dt>On macOS</dt>
<dd>Download and unzip <code>Cosma.app.zip</code>, then place it in <code>~/Applications</code>. For the first launch, right click on the application then select Open to run it.</dd>
<dt>On Windows</dt>
<dd>Download and unzip <code>Cosma-win32-x64.zip</code>, then rename the folder <code>Cosma</code> and place it in <code>C:\Program Files</code> or <code>C:\Program Files (86)</code>.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="support-folder" tabindex="-1">Support folder</h3>
<p>Installing Cosma automatically creates a support folder at this location (where <code>*</code> stands for the username):</p>
<dl>
<dt>On macOS</dt>
<dd><code>/Users/*/Library/Application Support/cosma</code></dd>
<dt>On Windows</dt>
<dd><code>C:\Utilisateurs\*\AppData\Roaming\cosma</code></dd>
</dl>
<p>Among other files needed to run the application, this is where you will find the <code>config.json</code> file in which Cosma automatically stores your configuration.</p>
<h3 id="updating" tabindex="-1">Updating</h3>
<p>Cosma is not updated automatically. You can be notified of an update by subscribing to either of these sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://groupes.renater.fr/sympa/info/cosma-annonces">cosma-annonces</a> (email list dedicated exclusively to Cosma update announcements);</li>
<li><a href="https://cosma.graphlab.fr/feed.xml">RSS feed of Cosma’s website</a> (contains release notes published on the site).</li>
</ul>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>If Cosma does not work anymore after an update:</strong> the structure of the <a href="#support-folder">support folder</a> has probably been modified and is not compatible with the old version. Delete the user folder and restart the application. The support folder will be re-created and will work correctly. You may want to make a copy of the <code>config.json</code> file: this will allow you to restore it more quickly after the support folder is re-created.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="creating-content" tabindex="-1">Creating content</h2>
<div class="important">
<p>To create content in Cosma, you must first specify a directory in Preferences › General › Records directory. The directory can be empty or contain records. Cosma ignores subdirectories: only the records immediately present at the root of directory are taken into account.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="creating-records" tabindex="-1">Creating records</h3>
<p>Click on File › New record (<code>Ctrl/Cmd + N</code>) to open the record creation form.</p>
<p>Only the title is mandatory. Other fields are optional.</p>
<p>You can assign a type to the new record. This type must be defined beforehand in Preferences › Record types.</p>
<p>You can also add keywords to the record. Keywords must be separated by commas. For example: <code>keyword 1, keyword 2</code>.</p>
<p>Click OK to create the record.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>The filename will be generated from the title. For better interoperability between different operating systems, the filename contains only unaccented alphanumeric characters and dashes.</p>
<p>Example: a record entitled “Déjà vu” will be saved as <code>deja-vu.md</code>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="data-format" tabindex="-1">Data format</h3>
<p>Cosma does not require that you use any particular writing software. However, it only correctly interprets files that comply with the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>content is written in Markdown, file extension is <code>.md</code>;</li>
<li>metadata is expressed in YAML, in a header at the beginning of the file;</li>
<li>internal links are expressed with a wiki-like syntax (double brackets <code>[[ ]]</code>) and based on unique identifiers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following subsections explain these rules in detail.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>This combination of writing standards combines several textual cultures: documentation (enriching and indexing content with metadata); wikis (interrelating documents); the Zettelkasten method (organising one's notes); academic writing with Pandoc (using plain text as a source for exporting in various formats).</p>
<p>Therefore, Cosma works particularly well when used in tandem with writing environments that also adopt this approach, such as <a href="https://zettlr.com">Zettlr</a> or the <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/">Foam</a> extension for Visual Studio Code and VSCodium.</p>
</div>
<p>You can create a Cosma-compliant file via the application's record creation form (click File › New record, or type <code>Ctrl + N</code>) or manually with the text editor of your choice. Some text editors can save you time with document templates, which you can use to quickly create records for Cosma.</p>
<h4 id="metadata" tabindex="-1">Metadata</h4>
<p>In order to be correctly interpreted by Cosma, Markdown files (<code>.md</code>) must include a <a href="http://yaml.org">YAML</a> header at the beginning of the file.</p>
<p>This header is created automatically when you create a file via Cosma. You can also create it manually, or with the help of a template in certain text editors.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: Title of the record
id: 20201209111625
type: undefined
tags:
- keyword 1
- keyword 2
---
</code></pre>
<p>The YAML header is delimited by two sets of three single dashes on a line (<code>---</code>).</p>
<p>In YAML, a field consists of a name and a value separated by a colon. Cosma recognises and uses the following four fields:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>title</code></dt>
<dd>Mandatory.</dd>
<dd>Title of the record.</dd>
<dt><code>id</code></dt>
<dd>Mandatory.</dd>
<dd>Unique identifier of the record. Must be a unique number. By default, Cosma generates 14-digit identifiers in the form of a timestamp (year, month, day, hours, minutes and seconds). This is inspired by Zettelkasten note-taking applications such as <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/">The Archive</a> and <a href="https://www.zettlr.com">Zettlr</a>.</dd>
<dt><code>type</code></dt>
<dd>Optional.</dd>
<dd>Record type. Only one type can be assigned to a record. If the <code>type</code> field is not specified or its value does not match one of the types declared in the configuration, Cosma will interpret the type of the record as <code>undefined</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>tags</code></dt>
<dd>Optional.</dd>
<dd>Keywords assigned to the record. The value must be a list. A record can have as many keywords as you wish. You can use <code>keywords</code> instead of <code>tags</code>, for compatibility with Pandoc. If a record has a <code>tags</code> field and a <code>keywords</code> field, only the keywords declared in the <code>tags</code> field are interpreted by Cosma.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In accordance with the YAML specification, the list of keywords can be written in <em>block</em> mode:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">tags:
- keyword 1
- keyword 2
</code></pre>
<p>Or in <em>flow</em> mode:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">tags: [keyword 1, keyword 2]
</code></pre>
<p>You can add additional YAML fields arbitrarily. You may for example include fields recognized by Pandoc.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Why a YAML header?</strong></p>
<p>Some applications opt to recognize file metadata heuristically. For example, if the first line of the file is a level 1 heading, then it will be interpreted as the title of the file; if the second line contains words prefixed with a <code>#</code> pound sign, then they will be interpreted as keywords.</p>
<p>This method is not interoperable: each program has its own conventions, which limits the user's ability to change tools.</p>
<p>Using a YAML header allows writers to declare different metadata explicitly and separately. This has the advantage of making the detection and manipulation of this metadata trivial, both by machines and humans. The use of a common format (such as YAML) increases the number of tools that can be used seamlessly with the same set of files. And widely used computer tools such as regular expressions and shell scripts allow people to convert their data themselves in a relatively simple way if needed.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="content" tabindex="-1">Content</h4>
<p>Cosma interprets files as being written in <a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/">CommonMark</a>, a strictly defined version of Markdown, a popular lightweight markup language.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>The <a href="https://commonmark.org/help/">CommonMark tutorial</a> teaches you the basics of Markdown in 10 minutes.</p>
<p>If you want to learn how to use Markdown and Pandoc together, check out this online lesson: <a href="https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown">Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and Markdown</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Cosma renders Markdown files into HTML. Therefore, Markdown files can also include HTML code. Cosma also supports <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-attrs">adding attributes by brackets</a>, as shown below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">&lt;div class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;This paragraph will be red&lt;/div&gt;

This paragraph will be red{.red}
</code></pre>
<p>Bitmap images can also be rendered using the Markdown syntax. Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">![Alternative text](image.jpg)
</code></pre>
<p>However, the actual image files are not included when exporting a cosmoscope. To ensure that images are displayed in the export, you should use images hosted on the web, including them via their URL. Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">![Alternative text](http://domain.com/image.jpg)
</code></pre>
<h4 id="links" tabindex="-1">Links</h4>
<p>Within a record, you link to another record by writing its identifier between double brackets.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>A link to [[20201209111625]] record B.
</code></pre>
<p>Cosma allows you to define <a href="#link-types">link types</a>. Each link type is defined by a name, a colour and a stroke pattern. To apply a type to a link, add the name of the type followed by a colon before the identifier.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>Concept B is derived from [[generic:20201209111625]] concept A.

Person D wrote against [[opponent:20201209111625]] person C.
</code></pre>
<div class="tip">
<p>To improve the readability of records in the cosmoscope, Cosma includes an option to customise the text of the links. Under Preferences › Link symbol, enter one or more Unicode characters (letters, numbers, symbols…). Example: ☞. This string replaces the identifier and square brackets in the HTML rendering of the records.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="unique-identifiers" tabindex="-1">Unique identifiers</h4>
<p>To be correctly interpreted by Cosma, each record must have a unique identifier. This identifier serves as a target for links between records.</p>
<p>The identifier must contain only numbers. By default, Cosma generates 14-digit identifiers in the form of a timestamp (year, month, day, hours, minutes and seconds). This is inspired by Zettelkasten note-taking applications such as <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/">The Archive</a> and <a href="https://www.zettlr.com">Zettlr</a>.</p>
<p>We plan to eventually allow the user to define an identifier pattern of their choice, like in Zettlr.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>Many interrelated note-taking applications use file names as targets for links between files. They maintain links automatically when file names are changed. By choosing to use unique identifiers instead, we have designed Cosma with a more traditional, stricter, WWW-like approach. We believe this is the easiest way to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a> in a sustainable way. Avoiding the reliance on automatic link maintenance is especially important if you wish to make your data less dependent on specific applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="tip">
<p>Links based on unique identifiers have disadvantages, mainly in terms of user experience: they are cumbersome to write and to read, especially when the identifier is a long series of numbers. In Preferences › Link symbol, you can define a string of characters (as small and visually distinct as the manicle ☞), which Cosma will display instead of the identifiers as the text of links in the cosmoscope.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="creating-a-cosmoscope" tabindex="-1">Creating a cosmoscope</h2>
<p>Click on New cosmoscope (<code>Cmd/Ctrl + R</code>) to generate a new cosmoscope. It will automatically appear in the main window.</p>
<p>Cosma automatically creates an error report that describes any problems encountered during the generation of a cosmoscope. Click on File › History (<code>Cmd/Ctrl + H</code>) and select an entry to view the associated error report.</p>
<h2 id="citations-and-bibliographies" tabindex="-1">Citations and bibliographies</h2>
<p>Cosma includes the option to automatically process citations and generate bibliographies. This is based on the same ecosystem as <a href="https://www.zettlr.com">Zettlr</a>: bibliographic data and styles use the <a href="https://citationstyles.org">Citation Style Language (CSL)</a> standard, while the insertion of citations within Markdown files uses the <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citation-syntax">Pandoc citation syntax</a>.</p>
<h3 id="required-files" tabindex="-1">Required files</h3>
<p>To process citations, Cosma requires three files:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Bibliographic data</dt>
<dd>File containing metadata describing bibliographic references. The required format is CSL JSON (extension <code>.json</code>).</dd>
<dt>Bibliographic style</dt>
<dd>File containing formatting rules for citations and bibliographies. The required format is CSL (extension <code>.csl</code>). You can download style files from the <a href="https://www.zotero.org/styles">Zotero CSL styles directory</a>.</dd>
<dt>Bibliographic localization</dt>
<dd>File containing localized bibliographic terms (e.g. publisher, issue…) in the language of your choice. The required format is XML (extension <code>.xml</code>). You can download localisation files from the <a href="https://github.com/citation-style-language/locales/tree/6b0cb4689127a69852f48608b6d1a879900f418b">CSL project GitHub repository</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the bibliographic data file, each reference must have a unique identifier (<code>id</code>) which serves as a citation key. Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">[
  {
    &quot;id&quot;:&quot;goody1977&quot;,
    &quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Goody&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jack&quot;}],

    &quot;type&quot;:&quot;book&quot;
  },
]
</code></pre>
<div class="tip">
<p>You can use the bibliographic reference manager <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> with the <a href="https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/">Better BibTeX</a> extension to create unique citation keys for each reference and have an automatically updated export of your library that Cosma can use.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="citation-syntax" tabindex="-1">Citation syntax</h3>
<p>To cite a reference in a record, include the citation key for that reference using the <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citation-syntax">Pandoc citation syntax</a>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>On writing as a technology of the intellect [@goody1977, 46-52]...
</code></pre>
<h3 id="creating-a-cosmoscope-with-citations" tabindex="-1">Creating a cosmoscope with citations</h3>
<p>Click on File › New cosmoscope with citations (<code>Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R</code>) to generate a cosmoscope with citation processing enabled. Citation processing is also available when <a href="#sharing">exporting</a>. Each citation key is then replaced with formatted text, and a bibliography is generated below the body of each record containing references.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>On writing as a technology of the intellect (Goody 1977, 46-52)…

<p>The CSL JSON data matching the cited references is embedded in the cosmoscope. You can view and download this data in the cosmoscope by clicking on the “Data” button at the bottom of the left-hand side menu. You can also access it from within the cosmoscope source code, under the <code>&lt;article id=&quot;citation-references&quot;&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<h2 id="history" tabindex="-1">History</h2>
<p>By default, Cosma automatically exports each cosmoscope to a <code>cosma-history</code> directory located in the operating system's temporary directories.</p>
<p>To enable or disable this, click Preferences › Automatically save cosmoscopes to history.</p>
<p>The active cosmoscope is always recorded in the history as the last entry. This last entry is opened when the application is launched. If the automatic recording of cosmoscopes is deactivated, this last entry will simply be overwritten with each new cosmoscope generated.</p>
<p>Click on File › History (<code>Cmd/Ctrl + H</code>) to view and manage the history entries using the following buttons:</p>
<dl>

<h2 id="using-the-cosmoscope" tabindex="-1">Using the cosmoscope</h2>
<h3 id="layout" tabindex="-1">Layout</h3>
<p>The cosmoscope is organised in three columns:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Left side panel (Menu)</dt>
<dd>Displays exploratory features such as the index, search bar, filters, views and graph settings.</dd>
<dt>Central area (Graph)</dt>
<dd>Displays the graph and associated controls (zoom, focus).</dd>
<dt>Right side panel (Record)</dt>
<dd>Displays the records with a list of outgoing links (Links) and incoming links (Backlinks).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Cosmoscopes opened in Cosma or exported and opened in a Web browser are functionally identical, with only one difference: the buttons at the top of the Menu are correspond to GUI features (creating records, generating cosmoscopes, etc.) and therefore are only displayed in Cosma.</p>
<h3 id="graph" tabindex="-1">Graph</h3>
<p>The central area of the cosmoscope is an interactive graph of labelled nodes. Each node corresponds to a record; the label corresponds to the title of the record. The links correspond to the links established between the records via their identifiers.</p>
<p>Hovering over a node temporarily highlights it and its connections. Clicking on a node highlights it and its connections and opens the corresponding record.</p>
<p>You can zoom in and out of the graph freely with a mouse or touchpad, by double-clicking on the graph background or with the dedicated buttons at the bottom left. Press <code>C</code> to zoom in on a selected node (whose record is open). The Reset button (shortcut: <code>R</code>) resets the zoom.</p>
<p>Nodes are organised in space by a force simulation algorithm. A coloured bar at the top of the Menu indicates the state of the drawing process (active or finished). Click on this bar (shortcut: <code>Space</code>) to start an additional simulation cycle. This does not reset the graph but re-runs the algorithm on the existing graph, improving its layout.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>If you have a particularly tangled graph, pressing <code>Space</code> a few times will progressively untangle it.</p>
</div>
<p>The graph is not fixed: nodes can be moved by click and drag. However, the nodes and links remain permanently subject to the simulation, so it is not possible to arrange them manually. Modifying the records may change the arrangement of the nodes in space.</p>
<p>The way the graph is displayed can be changed temporarily via the controls under Graph settings in the Menu. To change the display permanently, change the default values of the corresponding settings in Preferences › Graph.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>Change the strength and maximum distance between nodes to adapt the display to your screen resolution and size. Add vertical/horizontal attraction to tighten the graph and bring isolated nodes closer to the center.</p>
</div>
<p>The graph can be displayed on all types of screens but is not optimised for mobile devices: touch does not give access to certain interactions such as hovering, and small screens greatly limit the usefulness of the graph.</p>
<h3 id="records" tabindex="-1">Records</h3>
<p>Records can be opened by clicking on a node, an index entry, a search engine suggestion, or a link in the body or footer of a record. Opening a record displays its contents in the right side panel.</p>
<p>In Cosma, you can go forward or backward with the Previous / Next buttons located in the left side panel. In a web browser, you can do the same via the browser's Previous / Next functions. Opening a record adds the corresponding identifier at the end of the URL. This allows you to copy direct links to records.</p>
<p>Clicking on the “Close” button closes the right side panel and deselects the corresponding node in the graph.</p>
<p>The links in the records are clickable. In a browser, you can open these links in a new tab via a right click. The title of the link (displayed in a tooltip after 1-2 seconds of hovering) is the title of the corresponding card.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>To improve the readability of the records in the cosmoscope, Cosma includes an option to customise the text of the links. In Preferences › Link symbol, enter one or more Unicode characters (letters, numbers, symbols...). Example: ☞. This string replaces the identifier in square brackets in the HTML rendering of the records.</p>
</div>
<p>At the bottom of each record is a list of outgoing and incoming links (or backlinks). The links and backlinks are contextualised: when hovering over them, a tooltip is displayed, showing the paragraph that surrounds this link in the corresponding record.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>This is one the most useful features in hypertext systems. It is famously absent from the Web. Many interrelated note-taking applications treat links as “first-class citizens”, and this includes contextualised backlinks. However, when these notes are shared on the Web, this feature is not always included, or it is only inclued in a paid plan. With Cosma, contextualised backlinks are part of the package, whether you're the author of a cosmoscope working locally, or someone exploring a cosmoscope on the Web.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="focus-mode" tabindex="-1">Focus mode</h3>
<p>Activate Focus mode (shortcut: <code>F</code>) by ticking the “Focus” box at the bottom left of the graph. In Focus mode, only direct connections to the selected node are displayed in the interface. Focus mode only works if you have selected a record.</p>
<p>You can increase the maximum distance displayed in Focus mode with the slider located beneath the Focus button. The slider's maximum value can be set in Preferences › Maximum focus level. A value of 1 means only the immediate connections will be displayed when in Focus mode. A value of 2 means you can extend the focus two connections of connections, and so on.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>The focus level slider can be controlled with the arrow keys. You can combine shortcuts: <code>F</code> to activate Focus mode, then arrow keys to increase and decrease the focus level.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="search-bar" tabindex="-1">Search bar</h3>
<p>The text field at the top of the Menu allows you to search record titles. It suggests a list of records whose title is closest to what you type in the search bar (using fuzzy search). Clicking on a suggestion selects the corresponding node in the graph and opens the corresponding record in the right side panel.</p>
<div class="important">
<p>The available suggestions are constrained by the <a href="#filter-display-by-types">filters</a> and the <a href="#focus-mode">focus-mode</a>: a record hidden by either of these features will not be accessible via the search engine. When you want to start from scratch for a new query, you can click on Reset display (shortcut: <code>Alt</code> + <code>R</code>).</p>
</div>
<h3 id="filtering-by-record-type" tabindex="-1">Filtering by record type</h3>
<p>The list of record types in the Menu allows you to filter the display. Deselecting a type hides the corresponding records in the graph, index and search engine suggestions. Deselecting a type while holding down the <code>Alt</code> key hides the records of all the other types.</p>
<p>For a type to appear in this list, it must be declared in Preferences › Record types and be assigned to at least one record.</p>
<h3 id="filtering-by-keywords" tabindex="-1">Filtering by keywords</h3>
<p>The list of keywords in Menu allows you to highlight records that use the selected keywords. Selecting a keyword highlights the label of the corresponding nodes in the graph and restricts the index to the corresponding records. You can activate several keywords simultaneously. To deactivate a keyword, click the corresponding button again.</p>
<p>For a keyword to appear, it must have been declared in the <code>tags</code> field of the YAML header of at least one record.</p>
<h3 id="index" tabindex="-1">Index</h3>
<p>The alphabetical index of records in the Menu allows you to select a record from a list rather than through the graph. Clicking on a title selects the corresponding node in the graph and opens the corresponding record. The index can be sorted in ascending or descending alphabetical order.</p>
<div class="important">
<p>Record type filters, keywords and Focus mode all modify the display of the index. A record hidden by either of these features will not be accessible via the search engine. You can reset all these effects by clicking on the “Reset current view” button under Views in the Menu (shortcut: <code>Alt</code> + <code>R</code>).</p>
</div>
<h3 id="views" tabindex="-1">Views</h3>
<p>At any time, the state of the graph (selected record, active filters, focus mode) can be saved for quick access. This works like a bookmark. Click the Save view button under Views in the Menu and enter a name. This adds an eponymous button to the Views section. Clicking this button applies all settings that were active at the time the view was saved. Clicking the button again restores the normal view.</p>
<p>Views are preserved when exported. However, it is not possible to create a new view from an export. This is only possible from within Cosma.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-a-cosmoscope" tabindex="-1">Sharing a cosmoscope</h2>
<p>Click on File › Share (<code>Cmd/Ctrl + E</code>) to export a comoscope to be used outside of the application.</p>
<p>Two options are available:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Process citations</dt>
<dd>Process citation keys to generate bibliographies within the records and add bibliographic data to the cosmoscope.</dd>
<dt>Custom CSS</dt>
<dd>Apply a custom CSS stylesheet to modify the appearance of the cosmoscope.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="note">
<p>If the options are greyed out, it means that the corresponding settings in Preferences are not filled in.</p>
</div>
<p>Cosmoscopes exported via the Share menu include metadata (title, author, description, keywords) if they are set in Preferences › Metadata. These are displayed in the “About” panel. They are also included in the cosmoscope source code in the form of <code>meta</code> tags.</p>
<p>The toolbar at the top of the Menu only works in Cosma. It is therefore hidden in cosmoscopes exported via the Share menu. If a title has been set in Preferences › Metadata, it will be displayed instead.</p>
<p>The exported <code>cosmoscope.html</code> file can be shared like any other computer file: email, file transfer, messaging, uploading to a server…</p>
<p>In the case of a cosmoscope published on the Web, it is possible to link directly to a record by adding its identifier preceded by a <code>#</code> pound sign at the end of the URL. Example:</p>
<p><code>https://domain.com/cosmoscope.html#20210427185546</code></p>
<h2 id="configuration" tabindex="-1">Configuration</h2>
<p>Click Preferences (<code>Ctrl + o</code> or <code>Cmd + ,</code>) to configure Cosma.</p>
<div class="important">
<p>Most of the configuration options will only work if a directory is set in Preferences › General › Records directory.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="general" tabindex="-1">General</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Select a display language</dt>
<dd>Allows you to choose the language you wish to apply to the application interface and to the cosmoscopes.</dd>
<dd>The application must be restarted for the language change to take effect. Cosma also does not automatically re-generate a cosmoscope following a change of language. It is therefore necessary to manually re-generate a cosmoscope to see the change take effect.</dd>
<dt>Records directory</dt>
<dd>Path to the directory containing the Markdown files. New records created with Cosma are added to this directory.</dd>
<dt>Automatically save cosmoscopes in the history</dt>
<dd>By default, Cosma automatically exports each cosmoscope to a <code>cosma-history</code> directory located in the operating system's temporary directories. Uncheck this option to disable this automatic export. The active cosmoscope is always recorded in the history as the last entry. This last entry is opened when the application is launched. If the automatic recording of cosmoscopes is deactivated, this last entry will simply be overwritten with each new cosmoscope generated..</dd>
<dt>Link symbol</dt>
<dd>Enter one or more Unicode characters (letters, numbers, symbols…). Example: ☞. This string replaces the identifier and square brackets in the HTML rendering of the records.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="record-types" tabindex="-1">Record types</h3>
<p>This section allows you to define different types of records. For each type, enter a name and a colour.</p>
<p>To assign a type to a record, add <code>type: name</code> to its YAML header. Only one type can be assigned to a record. If the <code>type</code> field is not specified or its value does not match one of the types stored in the configuration, Cosma will interpret the type of the record as <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>The colour of the <code>undefined</code> type can be changed, but the type cannot be removed.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="link-types" tabindex="-1">Link types</h3>
<p>This section allows you to define different types of links. For each type, enter a name, a colour and a stroke type. The available stroke types are:</p>
<ul>
<li>single</li>
<li>double</li>
<li>dash</li>
<li>dotted</li>
</ul>
<p>To apply a type to a link, add the name of the type followed by a colon before the identifier.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>The colour and stroke type of the <code>undefined</code> type can be changed, but the type cannot be removed.</p>
</div>
<div class="tip">
<p>The graphic settings of the links affect their readability in the graph. For example, if you set undefined links to grey dotted lines and a special link type to black solid lines, the special links will be more visible in the graph.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="graph-1" tabindex="-1">Graph</h3>
<p>The graph parameters can be changed live in the cosmoscope. This allows you to test different values before transferring them to the configuration. The values set in the configuration are restored each time the cosmoscope is reloaded and each time a new one is generated.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Background colour</dt>
<dd>The background colour of the graph.</dd>
<dt>Highlight colour</dt>
<dd>The colour that is applied to nodes and links when hovering and selecting.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="note">
<p>We made these two colour settings accessible via the interface as they are likely to be changed by many users. But all interface colours can be changed using a custom CSS style sheet (see Configuration › Advanced).</p>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>Label text size</dt>
<dd>Defines the size of the text of the labels of the nodes of the graph. The size is in pixels. The value must be between 5 and 15.</dd>
<dt>Maximum focus level</dt>
<dd>Defines the maximum distance between the selected nodes and the connections showed when in Focus mode. A value of 1 means only the immediate connections will be displayed when in Focus mode. A value of 2 means you can extend the focus two connections of connections, and so on.</dd>
<dt>Show arrows on links</dt>
<dd>This allows you to obtain a directed or undirected graph.</dd>
</dl>
<h4 id="spatialisation" tabindex="-1">Spatialisation</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Strength of attraction</dt>
<dd>The overall strength of the simulated attraction between nodes. The lower the value, the looser the links between the nodes.</dd>
<dt>Maximum distance between nodes</dt>
<dd>Maximum threshold of repulsion between nodes. Above a value of 1000, this parameter has no measurable effect.</dd>
<dt>Vertical/horizontal attraction</dt>
<dd>A value of 0 means that the parameter is disabled. Applying a vertical/horizontal force tightens the graph and brings isolated nodes closer to the centre.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="metadata-1" tabindex="-1">Metadata</h3>
<p>You can define global metadata for the cosmoscope:</p>
<ul>
<li>title</li>
<li>author</li>
<li>keywords</li>
<li>description</li>
</ul>
<p>Cosmoscopes exported via the Share menu include this metadata when it exists. The title replaces the buttons at the top left of the menu, which are only displayed in the application. The metadata is displayed in the “About” panel. It is also included in the cosmoscope source code as <code>meta</code> tags.</p>
<h3 id="bibliography" tabindex="-1">Bibliography</h3>

<div class="tip">
<p>To find out which selectors to use for which declaration, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>click on View › Development Tools (if Show development tools is on);</li>
<li>open the cosmoscope in a web browser and use the browser's development tools;</li>

</ul>
<p>The cosmoscope stylesheets use CSS variables to define the colours and fonts used. You can redefine only these variables to change all the interface elements to which they apply. In the example below, the <code>custom.css</code> file contains declarations that change the fonts used in the cosmoscope:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">:root {

<pre><code>npm i @graphlab-fr/cosma -g
</code></pre>
<h3 id="configuration-(cli)" tabindex="-1">Configuration (CLI)</h3>
<p>The configuration of the CLI version is done in a <code>config.yml</code> file written in YAML. This file is generated at the root of the application directory by running <code>cosma</code> for the first time:</p>

<dd>The location of a file in JSON format describing the records to be created.</dd>
<dd>The file should be structured as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<pre><code class="language-json">[
  {
    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Title of the record&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;undefined&quot;,
    &quot;tags&quot;: &quot;keyword1,keyword2&quot;,
    &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Contents of the record, including [[20210704100343]] links.&quot;
  },
  ...

</code></pre>
<p>As with all other record creation modes, the title (<code>title</code>) is mandatory and the other fields are optional.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Batch record creation and identifiers</strong></p>
<p>Cosma generates 14-digit identifiers in the form of a timestamp (year, month, day, hours, minutes and seconds). This means you can manually create one record per second, or 86,400 records per day. Another way to phrase it is to say there is a range of 86,400 identifiers reserved for manual record creation each day. For example, on 15 January 2022, these identifiers range from 20220115000000 to 20220115235959.</p>
<p>To prevent generating duplicate identifiers, the batch creation mode generates identifiers by pseudo-timestamp. The first 8 digits, corresponding to the date (year, month, day), are real. Example: 20220115 (15 January 2022). On the other hand, those corresponding to the hours, minutes and seconds are false, generated outside of real time ranges. Example: 256495. As it is impossible to create a record manually at 25h 64min and 95s, there is no risk of generating duplicate identifiers by using both methods simultaneously.</p>
<p>Because of this operation, it is possible to create up to 913,599 records per day and per directory in batch mode before running out of identifiers.</p>

<pre><code>cosma modelize
cosma m
</code></pre>
<p>The following command allows you to generate a Cosmoscope without having entered a source directory. This is an example export containing explanations on how to use the software.</p>
<pre><code>cosma modelize --sample
</code></pre>
<h3 id="options" tabindex="-1">Options</h3>
<p>Various options can be added to the <code>modelize</code> command.</p>
<p>Like commands, options have a long and a short form, which are functionally identical, the short form is simply there to save time if needed.</p>
<p>Options are also used to modify configuration values on the fly.</p>
<h4 id="create-a-cosmoscope-with-citations-(cli)" tabindex="-1">Create a cosmoscope with citations (CLI)</h4>
<pre><code>cosma modelize --citeproc

<h4 id="include-a-custom-css-stylesheet" tabindex="-1">Include a custom CSS stylesheet</h4>
<pre><code>cosma modelize --custom-css
cosma m -css
</code></pre>
<p>This option applies the custom CSS stylesheet specified in the configuration.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>You can combine the different export options as follows:</p>
<pre><code>cosma modelize --citeproc --custom-css

<h3 id="gui" tabindex="-1">GUI</h3>
<h4 id="gui-12" tabindex="-1">GUI 1.2</h4>
<p>This update adds the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The records directory is now read recursively. This means all records are now taken into account, whatever their location in a possible subdirectory structure.</li>
<li>HTML elements used in the text of records are now recognized and interpreted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bugs have also been solved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Context tooltips for typed links are no longer empty (issue #15).</li>
<li>Clicking on saved views displays them correctly (issue #16).</li>
<li>Vertical and horizontal attraction settings are no longer switched (issue #18).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gui-11" tabindex="-1">GUI 1.1</h4>
<p>This update introduces a full English translation of the application, as well as a few bug fixes and small interface improvements.</p>
<ul>
<li>The application is translated into English, visit Preferences › General to switch languages.</li>
<li>Creating a record without first specifying a directory no longer causes an error but returns an informative message (issue #6).</li>
<li>Creating a record with a title already in use no longer silently overwrites the existing record but asks for confirmation (issue #5).</li>
<li>It is now possible to use <code>keywords</code> instead of <code>tags</code> in the records' YAML header (issue #3).</li>
<li>It is no longer necessary to declare a record type in the configuration before assigning it to a new record.</li>
<li>The Preferences window has been reorganised into sections.</li>
<li>The readability of error reports has been improved.</li>
<li>The <code>minify</code> option to reduce the size of exports, which was not functional in v1.0, has been removed.</li>
<li>The application is now distributed with its documentation, accessible via Help › Manual or by clicking on the Help button at the bottom left of the cosmoscope.</li>
<li>The source code has been reorganised to allow the simultaneous development of a command line version (<a href="https://github.com/graphlab-fr/cosma-cli">cosma-cli</a>) from the same code base (<a href="https://github.com/graphlab-fr/cosma-core">cosma-core</a>).</li>
<li>Upgrade from Electron v13 to v15.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gui-10" tabindex="-1">GUI 1.0</h4>
<p>Initial release of Cosma GUI (French only).</p>
<h3 id="cli" tabindex="-1">CLI</h3>
<h4 id="cli-11" tabindex="-1">CLI 1.1</h4>
<p>This update adds the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>New <code>modelize</code> option, <code>--config</code>, the value of which must be the absolute path of a config file. This makes Cosma CLI capable of working with multiple directories, without having to manually shuffle around config files in the support folder.</li>
<li>If a config file includes YAML syntax mistakes, an error is thrown with a helpful message.</li>
<li>Records directories are now read recursively. This means all records are now taken into account, whatever their location in a possible subdirectory structure.</li>
<li>HTML elements used in the text of records are now recognized and interpreted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bugs have also been solved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Context tooltips for typed links are no longer empty (issue #15).</li>
<li>Clicking on saved views displays them again (issue #16).</li>
<li>Vertical and horizontal attraction settings are no longer switched (issue #18).</li>
<li>The <code>--custom-css</code> (or <code>-css</code>) option works again (issue #19).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cli-10" tabindex="-1">CLI 1.0</h4>
<p>The following changes have been made since the alpha:</p>
<ul>
<li>The source code has been reorganised to allow the simultaneous development of the GUI and CLI versions from the same code base (<a href="https://github.com/graphlab-fr/cosma-core">cosma-core</a>).</li>
<li>The configuration file <code>config.yml</code> has been reorganised. The software is not backwards compatible: if you had a <code>config.yml</code> file from the alpha, it will be necessary to re-create a compliant <code>config.yml</code> file via the <code>cosma config</code> command and then modify it. The location of the file now depends on the Cosma CLI installation path. On Windows: <code>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\@graphlab-en\cosma\config.yml</code>. On macOS and Linux: <code>/usr/local/lib/node_modules/@graphlab-fr/cosma/config.yml</code>.</li>
<li>A new <code>cosma batch</code> command allows you to create multiple records in one go. It is documented <a href="https://cosma.graphlab.fr/docs/manuel-utilisation/#creer-un-lot-de-fiches">here</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>minify</code> option to reduce the size of exports, which was not functional in v1.0, has been removed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cli-10-alpha" tabindex="-1">CLI 1.0-alpha</h4>
<p>Alpha release of Cosma CLI (French only).</p>
