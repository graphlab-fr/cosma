Records can be opened by clicking on a node, an index entry, a search engine suggestion, or a link in the body or footer of a record. Opening a record displays its contents in the right side panel.

In Cosma, you can go forward or backward with the Previous / Next buttons located in the left side panel. In a web browser, you can do the same via the browser's Previous / Next functions. Opening a record adds the corresponding identifier at the end of the URL. This allows you to copy direct links to records.

Clicking on the “Close” button closes the right side panel and deselects the corresponding node in the graph.

The links in the records are clickable. In a browser, you can open these links in a new tab via a right click. The title of the link (displayed in a tooltip after 1-2 seconds of hovering) is the title of the corresponding card.

To improve the readability of the records in the cosmoscope, Cosma includes an option to customise the text of the links. In Preferences › Link symbol, enter one or more Unicode characters (letters, numbers, symbols...). Example: ☞. This string replaces the identifier in square brackets in the HTML rendering of the records.

## Contextualised links and backlinks

At the bottom of each record is a list of outgoing and incoming links (or backlinks). The links and backlinks are contextualised: when hovering over them, a tooltip is displayed, showing the paragraph that surrounds this link in the corresponding record.

This is one the most useful features in hypertext systems. It is famously absent from the Web. Many interrelated note-taking applications treat links as “first-class citizens”, and this includes contextualised backlinks. However, when these notes are shared on the Web, this feature is not always included, or it is only inclued in a paid plan. With Cosma, contextualised backlinks are part of the package, whether you're the author of a cosmoscope working locally, or someone exploring a cosmoscope on the Web.
