Click on File › Share (`Cmd/Ctrl + E`) to export a [[20210901140150]] comoscope to be used outside of the application.

Two options are available:

- Process citations: process citation keys to generate bibliographies within the records and add bibliographic data to the cosmoscope.
- Custom CSS: apply a custom CSS stylesheet to modify the appearance of the cosmoscope.

If the options are greyed out, it means that the corresponding settings in Preferences are not filled in.

Cosmoscopes exported via the Share menu include metadata (title, author, description, keywords) if they are set in Preferences › Metadata. These are displayed in the “About” panel. They are also included in the cosmoscope source code in the form of `meta` tags.

The toolbar at the top of the Menu only works in Cosma. It is therefore hidden in cosmoscopes exported via the Share menu. If a title has been set in Preferences › Metadata, it will be displayed instead.

The exported `cosmoscope.html` file can be shared like any other computer file: email, file transfer, messaging, uploading to a server…

In the case of a cosmoscope published on the Web, it is possible to link directly to a record by adding its identifier preceded by a `#` pound sign at the end of the URL. Example:

`https://domain.com/cosmoscope.html#20210427185546`
