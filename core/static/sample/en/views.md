At any time, the state of the graph (selected record, active filters, focus mode) can be saved for quick access. This works like a bookmark. Click the Save view button under Views in the Menu and enter a name. This adds an eponymous button to the Views section. Clicking this button applies all settings that were active at the time the view was saved. Clicking the button again restores the normal view.

Views are preserved when exported. However, it is not possible to create a new view from an export. This is only possible from within Cosma.
