Welcome to Cosma, a visualization and sharing tool for knowledge workers [@cosma].

Cosma exists in two different versions that can be downloaded and used separately: a desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI version) and a command-line tool (CLI version).

The inner workings of Cosma are made of two parts: a [[20210901133503]] cosmographer and a [[20210901140150]] cosmoscope. The cosmographer reads a directory of text files written in Markdown, and renders them as a single HTML file called the cosmoscope. The cosmoscope is displayed in the main window of Cosma. It can also be used as a standalone file.

You are currently browsing a cosmoscope which serves as a quick-start documentation as well as a demonstration of how Cosma works. [A more comprehensive user documentation is available online](https://cosma.graphlab.fr/en/docs/).
