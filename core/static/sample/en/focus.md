Activate Focus mode (shortcut: `F`) by ticking the “Focus” box at the bottom left of the graph. In Focus mode, only direct connections to the selected node are displayed in the interface. Focus mode only works if you have selected a record.

You can increase the maximum distance displayed in Focus mode with the slider located beneath the Focus button. The slider's maximum value can be set in Preferences › Maximum focus level. A value of 1 means only the immediate connections will be displayed when in Focus mode. A value of 2 means you can extend the focus two connections of connections, and so on.

The focus level slider can be controlled with the arrow keys. You can combine shortcuts: `F` to activate Focus mode, then arrow keys to increase and decrease the focus level.
