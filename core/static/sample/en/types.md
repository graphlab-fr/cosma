The list of record types in the Menu allows you to filter the display. Deselecting a type hides the corresponding records in the graph, index and search engine suggestions. Deselecting a type while holding down the `Alt` key hides the records of all the other types.

For a type to appear in this list, it must be declared in Preferences â€º Record types and be assigned to at least one record.
