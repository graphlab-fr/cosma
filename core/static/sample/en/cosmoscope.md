The cosmoscope is an HTML file containing your records as well as tools to explore and interact with them. It is generated by the cosmographer and displayed in the main window of Cosma. But it is also a standalone file, which you can share and use outside of the application without any difference in content or functionality.

## Content

The cosmoscope is organized in three areas.

The left side panel of the cosmoscope is the Menu. It contains various exploratory features and interactive settings: [[20210901143958]] index, [[20210901143134]] search, [[20210901143447]] types, [[20210901143845]] keywords and [[20210901144304]] views.

The central area of the cosmoscope displays the [[20210901142644]] graph and associated controls (zoom and [[20210901143014]] focus).

The right side panel of the cosmoscope displays the [[20210901142849]] records, with their metadata, their content and a list of links and backlinks.

## Use outside of Cosma

The cosmoscope can exported from Cosma. View an exported cosmoscope by opening it in a web browser.Â It can be shared like any other computer file: email, file transfer, messaging, uploading on a server, etc.

With an online cosmoscope, you can send links to specific records by adding a `#` sign and the corresponding identifier at the end of the URL. For example:

`https://name.tld/cosmoscope.html#20210427185546`
